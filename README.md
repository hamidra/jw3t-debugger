# JW3T Debugger

This is a simple proof of concept JSON Web3 token generator, which is using [jw3t package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jw3t) to generate and verify json web3 tokens.  
The usual test signers (Alice, Bob, Dave, ...) are loaded by default and if you have polkadot.js extension installed you can authorize the app to load your signer accounts from your extension.
